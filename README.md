# MonodromySolver
This repository contains files to solve for the zeros of a square polynomial system using random monodromy loops. 
It uses the solver Bertini, a numerical algebraic geometry solver (https://bertini.nd.edu/), within a Mathematica notebook environment to execute the same.
This algorithm research involves aspects of kinematics, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, complex analysis, ordinary differential equations, data processing and statistical estimation.
